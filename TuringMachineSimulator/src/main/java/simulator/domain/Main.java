            Todos UI:
            - make it so that "new"-button opens a new window instead of changing the view
            - make it so that the user can add more rows to table in creation 
            - make it so that you can't finish without giving the proper information in creation scene
            - make it so that user gets to decide a name for the project folder
            - fix description label alignment
            - ...
        
            Todos domain:
            - create simulator class and start building it
            - interfaces, anyone?
