            - remove source.txt
            - figure how to make junit tests for daos
        
            Todos UI:
            - create gui for simulation
            - create the menu for main scene
            - make it so that you can't finish without giving the proper information in creation scene    
            - Add "-" column, (initial state) tag, alphabet and states labels to the table
            - fill the table with default properties
            - make it so that "new"-button opens a new window instead of changing the view
            - fix description label alignment
            - ...
        
            Todos domain:
            - WHEN THE TURING MACHINE DOESN'T (?) SEEM TO HALT set a limit to the simulation time and a limit for the tape so it doesn't print out crazy stuff
            - make it so that user can define initial state, accepting and rejecting states
            - more choices in creation "ignore all characters but x, ..."
            - ...
