# To do in the future
## Creating a Turing machine
- [ ] Let user name the accepting and rejecting states and define the blank symbol (that the tape will be initialized with)
- [ ] Make it possible to create a Turing machine by giving the program a file in the right format
- [ ] Add more default fill-in's to make it easier to create a table by hand
## Simulator
- [ ] **Add a possibility to pause and continue the simulation**
- [ ] **When paused, make it possible to pan the tape left and right to see what the whole tape looks like**
- [ ] Add a possibility to simulate steps backwards in manual simulation
- [ ] Make a better animation for manual and automatic simulation
- [ ] Make input from file possible
- [ ] Make a setting page where the user can change the tape size limit and the input limit and decide the default speed for automatic simulation. Hide tape size limit from the main window.
- [ ] Create a page or a list where the user can select a previously made Turing machine just by clicking a name on the list. It would also be nice to be able to view the description at the same time.
## Miscellaneous
- [ ] Create a better overall look with CSS
- [ ] Code building the UI is ridiculously long. Refactor it.
